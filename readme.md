I was inspired to mkae this project so that when you are playing a flight simulator you have acces to all of the most important buttons without ahving to reac acros your whole keyborad, It can aslo be used for FPS games as I designed it to incorperate a space for a wasd and a shift key. THis preject also allowed me to loearn the bacisc of pcb design and the basics of fusion 360.
